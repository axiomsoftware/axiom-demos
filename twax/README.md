twax
=========

twax is an application written to exemplify e4x on Axiom Stack. While it does more than that in terms of showing how objects are created, modules loaded, referencing, multivalues, and so on, the primary purpose is to show ways in which e4x can be used. This app makes some slight over use of e4x since it is a demo. A healthy mix of e4x and TALE would make this application faster.

*Disclaimer* - This should probably not be used for anything other than to try out the functionality. If you decide to use it for something real, Axiom Software and any developers will not be responsible for your data.

Modules
=========

Because Axiom Stack modules are placed in <axiom root>/modules and not within the application itself, you'll have to download the modules used.
